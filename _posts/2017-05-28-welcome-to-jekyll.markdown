Take all the physics laws we know so far and deploy it in a simulation of the universe. There should be a parallel simulation mimicking the current ways of things and then through comparison, we can fill in all the gaps. 

For example, if earth was a hot planet and it cooled to develop it's atmosphere, water and eventually organic life. We can simulate a hot earth, cool it down and study if the same chemical/biological compunds that gave rise to living organisms are produced. If this doesn't happen, either the variables are wrong or our theories need revisiting. 

We will probably need an insanely powerful computer to run such a simulation. But I will look into it.
