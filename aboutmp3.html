<h2 id='sub'>Open Source MP3</h2>
<p id = 'description'>
<a id='line' href = "https://www.facebook.com/ITChallenger?fref=ts">Daniel Lee</a> and I decided to build a product together. The first idea, that we came up with, was to build an open source mp3 player.<br> Which people could use on their website for free. While we played advertisements.<br>
<br>
To start with I used the basic <a id='line' href = "http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_audio.asp">HTML5 audio.</a><br> and to built the web app from that point. I then used simple jquery functions such as play,<br>pause and stop. And linked images, forming my basic control board.<br> 
<br>
<a id='line' href = "https://www.facebook.com/ITChallenger?fref=ts">Daniel Lee</a> was incharge of setting up the player in a server enabling a provision for file upload.<br>Using PHP and mySQL.
<br>
Like many of my projects, this will always go through numerous number of improvements and revisions.<br>
My next goal is to enable the player with a playlist generating option using javascript. Stay tuned for more information.
