    Creation Hour is an initiative that I started with the help of my club, EIA, and with collaboration with other clubs, Patent Pending, Design For America and also the Computer Science department. This initiative aims to create a community of makers who collaborate with each other to work on projects. It was started during the fall semester of 2015 and during this semester, we conducted weekly meetups, <a href="">Professor Knox</a> who also held weekly meetups to discuss project ideas with students, attended the meetups to brainstorm and give advice to students working on projects. We managed to inspire a small crowd of students to work on their own projects through this initiative. With a permanent location dedicated for this initiative and the involvement of people fron the startup and tech community, we are planning to reach more people through out the school and create a strong maker/hacker community at NYU.

    The leadership fellows program is a conglomeration of exceptional students from different backgrounds of NYU working together to learn about what leadership actually means in the real world. It is a year long program where undergraduate sophomores and juniors attend leadership workshops and work together on projects. Some of the workshops are, Foundations of Leadership, Finding your authentic voice, Personal development, Creative collaboration, and Collaboration accross differences. Fellows are also required to work together on a group project/initiative that creates an impact on the school campus by applying the leadership skills learnt through the workshop. I'll be posting about my team's initiative soon. The varied perspective of the fellows due to their backgrounds has greatly improved my perspective and has added tremendous value to my college education. If you're a sophomore/junior at NYU, you should definitely <a href="">apply</a> to be a leadership fellow.

    I'm the eboard member of the most badass club at NYU. EIA is a club which is trying to build a startup culture at NYU. All of our eboard members are startup nerds and are working on their own ventures. We all believe in creating a community of students who are fearless and motivated to start new ventures. EIA is divided into 5 teams/squads, representing the startup life cycle. The teams are - Ideation, Matchmaking, Minimum Viable Product, Funding and Innovention. You can learn more about those teams <a href="">here</a>. I lead the MVP team, and we are responsible creating a community where students can convert their ideas into prototypes and we leverage resources from the startup community in order to do so.

    Tech@NYU's Freshman Circuit is a group of freshmen led by an upperclassmen who visit tech companies around New York City. Some of the companies that we visited were, Nasdaq Design, Quirky, Facebook, Codecademy, AlleyNYC, Fresco etc. It exposed us to the tech and startup scene at NYC and opened new doors of opportunity. The coolest thing about the freshmen circuit is that every student who was a part of it is living their tech dreams by working at their favorite companies or their individual startups. We also go to a lot of hackathons.
