### My Opinion on Chatbots as an interface.

When Facebook released their Chatbot platform in 2016, I was really hyped. In fact, all my developer friends were hyped. A platform that more than a billion use on a hourly basis. Can you imagine the possibilities? We knew this was the next gold rush. Just like the appstore was for the iphone. (to be continued...)

### Intro

Hi, I'm Vidyadhar and this is my blog. People also call me Vd. My app is called Vidi. I didn't name it after me, infact it was my cofounder who named it Vidi. Just saying...<br>

So, I don't really know what I want to do with this blog. I do write a lot, most of my writing isn't public because it's really bad. I'm thinking of making this my Tech focussed semi-private blog. And the really good articles, I'm going to paste on Medium. I'm obviously just talking to myself at this point, but if you're reading this and you're not me. Hi! Thanks for visiting :)
