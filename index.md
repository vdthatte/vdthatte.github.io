### Intro

Hi, I'm Vidyadhar and this is my blog. People also call me Vd. My app is called Vidi. I didn't name it after me, infact it was my cofounder who named it Vidi. Just saying...<br>

So, I don't really know what I want to do with this blog. I do write a lot, most of my writing isn't public because it's really bad. I'm thinking of making this my Tech focussed semi-private blog. And the really good articles, I'm going to paste on Medium. I'm obviously just talking to myself at this point, but if you're reading this and you're not me. Hi! Thanks for visiting :)

### Starting Daily Blog
I was listening to a Seth Godin interview yesterday and I realized that he writes a daily blog. This is so freaking useful for putting your thoughts together and putting everything you've learnt in a single place. Nobody will probably read this, so I'm going to use this as my daily blog. Get ready to be mind blown. I'm still debating if this should be a vlog but let's see.

#### Friday - April 28th 2017 - Applying the Evolutio framework to every freaking thing in life.
Our complex human bodies originated from single celled organisms that combined into groups of multi celled organisms with a common goal of survival. They formed different permutations and combinations until the combination of species was able to endure longer than the previous generation of species. I don't know if this is how the universe actually works but it surely makes sense. So now apply this to every single thing you do in life. [tbc...]



#### Thursday - April 27th 2017 - How to stay relevant?
I'm super competitive. And when I one up my friends or collegues, I feel great - I also feel more relevant and secure as it might help me handle emergencies and disruption in quicker than others.

When I started building apps, I was a freshman in college and most of my friends were trying to understand loops and branches in programming. Ofcourse, there were also people who had dropeed out of school to build their companies and were way ahead of me in terms of technical knowledge. But I felt good because I was better than the average. But then a sudden realization hit me, no matter how fast I went in terms of gaining technical knowledge, all these people would eventually catch up to me or atleast would be comparably as good as I was because they would end up learning all this stuff anyway. Maybe me starting a little early would give me a little advantage but it wouldn't differntiate me in anyway. (we can argue that this will not be the case)

At some point in time, I decided to give up on getting good internships and instead started working on my own side-project which would eventually become my own startup. One of the major driving reasons for adopting this route was that I didn't have to compete with my friends who were going to get jobs for sure and I would also be in charge of my own destiny. I wouldn't have to depend on some external entity to "choose" me and give me permission to contribute to the world. This way, I could build spaceships or photo editors and make money and would need nobody's permission to do so. This is not for everybody and I now realise how insanely hard it is to pursue this path. But I would rather do this than go get a job anyway. Definitely no PHD and academics for me.

Now I'm a junior. All my friends are getting their internships. At really amazing places. And I'm out of the competition. We can't even compare because I'm doing something totally different. The dilemma is that, there is no way for me to measure if I'm relevant now. They could be learning much more important things than I am and there is no way to tell. So my true north/"internal compass" as Vinod Khosla calls it. is that I should just stop measuring my skills and abilities with my friends because there's no legitimate way to measure something like this. And instead, maybe, follow my curiosity and measure the number of things I ship and how much it contributes to the world around me.

#### Wednesday - April 26th 2017 - On dealing with (harsh) feedback 
Feedback and criticism is important because it will let you make your assumptions more concrete. We decided to use videos as the main media for information in our app and we got some really intense feedback for it. 

* Video market is saturated. 

* You need to have quality content for people to pay.

* It's hard to make videos. 

I felt stupid at the moment - how can I have not thought about this. But I had thought about this and I did have the answers. If making videos were hard, snapchat wouldn't be a thing. The future is videos and according to Zuck "the camera is going to replace the text box". You can convey so much more through video than you can convey using text. So why not give the best medium available to our users? 

Video market is saturated? that shouldn't even be a concern because we just want to make tools to the people we already know and aren't really being served by this current "video market". It takes time to make youtube videos and nobody's got the time. It's easier to use snapchat but it's not something that can be monetized - yet. And I don't care if the market is saturated, so was the search engine market before google showed up and so was the social networking market before facebook showed up. We want to solve problems and there's clearly a problem here. 

And finally, making videos takes time and is harder. Well. Videos are a better medium of communication, and more people should be putting out content through videos, and it's our job as designers of technology, to make it easy and seamless to produce content. So we shouldn't be giving up on this because making videos is hard, we should take it as a challenge and design a seamless process to make videos easily. Everybody has a story to tell and there's so much we can learn when these people tell their stories. 

The feedback that I recieved was almost relevant and it definitely helped me strengthen my assumptions. But I also wandered in Soho for 2 hours trying to make sense of this and set my emotions back in order. We all go through this when we recieve feedback, especially if it's critical - learning to deal with it makes us stronger and smarter.


### The Era of Apps isn't over and people who think so have no idea what they're talking about.

It's so annoying when people dismiss new apps by saying "ughh it's just another smartphone app." Our smartphones are more powerful than the computer that was used on Apollo 11 and most of what we do on them now is read memes and share pictures of our food. There's so much more potential to be unlocked and we're only going to do that if more people build apps.(to be continued...)

### My Opinion on Chatbots as an interface.

When Facebook released their Chatbot platform in 2016, I was really hyped. In fact, all my developer friends were hyped. A platform that more than a billion use on a hourly basis. Can you imagine the possibilities? We knew this was the next gold rush. Just like the appstore was for the iphone. (to be continued...)
