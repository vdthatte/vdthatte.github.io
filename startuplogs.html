The weather holycrap. 
<br/><br/>
Ok so I found another cool coffee shop to work from. Looks like I'll come here more often. I need to start sending emails like crazy now. I think one of the strategies is that I'll send about 100 emails and I'll split them into 3 parts and send 3 different types of emails. or split them into two parts and send 2 different types to see how people react. Honestly, I'm just anxious about people not responding to my emails. But I think this is what hustling is, dealing with crickets after you put your heart and sould into a freaking email. But all I need is 10 people to really be invested in helping me out. I was also thinking about how moonlight work sent their emails. That shit was good and got me to respond to them. ME, who ignores almost everything. I'm also look for emailing tools to keep track of number of opens, etc.
<br/><br/>
So yeah, today is going to be sending emails until 8ish. Dinner. And coding all the way till 3am hopefully.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

 It's 95 F what the hell.  
<br/><br/>

Today has been an interesting day. Yesterday I ended up working pretty hard (and went out later too) but I think I put in like 10 hurs of work atleast. I compiled a list of 120+ artists in NYC area, and their websites which contain their contact info. So that I can reachout to them.
<br/><br/>
Next, I worked on te website fixed the edit profile bug and changed the home page a bit. The home page initially had a list of all the lessons on the website. But I only have a few lessons on the website now so that led to a lot of confusion while pitching the idea. So I added a blur filter on the lessons and added a message that says, "We’re working our asses off to bring together some of the best creators in New York City area to share their skills with all of us. Submit your email to stay updated." with an email textbox to accept signups from interested people.
<br/><br/>
Today, I think I'm running on 5 hours of sleep because I went to sleep at 5 and woke up at 10:30ish. And I started reading a lot of stuff. I found Jessica Livingston's amazing essay that I ended up sharing with people. I listened to Kevin Rose's podcast with Sean Ellis which led me to Sean's website and I read this phenomenal blog post about product. And how building a great product looks like. And what one has to focus on to test if the have a great product or not. I'm going to paste the link here and quote the important point:
<br/><br/>
http://www.startup-marketing.com/category/product/
<br/><br/>
"Great products aren’t anointed by product gurus.  Only customers can decide if a product is great."
<br/><br/>
- Greenfield users
<br/><br/>
- Focus either on the users that are using a competitve product. But focus on one segment not both.
<br/><br/>
- If you focus on the competitive product, lure them with differentiated features, and reduce conversion hurdles.
<br/><br/>
So I'm going to focus on users that use a competitive product like Craigslist, Airbnb experiences and Coursehorse. I've made all the features that I offer on the teacher onboard page and I'm refining the signup and lesson creation flow at the moment. I'm also going to look for how teachers react to this when I meet them in person.  
<br/><br/>
I'm going to spend most of today on refining the flow and reducing conversion friction. I'll do outreach to all the outreach tomorrow and also see if I need to modify the emails. I'm starting to realize how iterating quickly is super important now. Hoping this works.

It's 86 F in New York City and I've graduated from NYU. A lot of things have happened but I'm glad I'm still working on my startup. I've also decided to keep this daily blog thing going. This is just for me, to keep track of progress and reflect upon things. I don't really want to spend too much time filling in the details about what happened since October. But the main update is that I've named the company Graam Inc. and I've built out a really simple version of the website including stripe payments. I've also figured out the basic business model, mostly inspired from Airbnb. And now I'm on the roll trying to recruit teachers. 

<br/><br/>

It's not really a big challenge to recruit teachers. I can find most of them on 4 main channels, Yelp, Coursehorse, Airbnb experiences and Craigslist. Airbnb experiences has 68 classes in New York. I just need to beat that number by the end of July. Also, Course Horse's user experience is crap so I need to be 10x better than them and make it really easy for people to sign up and conduct business. Yelp isn't really a learning platform. So yeah it seems like I'm in a good place - product wise. I just need to recruit teachers. I've also noticed that recruiting teachers isn't hard because it's completely free for them to list their lesson. They just need to put in a few hours of work to setup their lessons. And making that process simple and intuitive should be the focus for now.

<br/><br/>

I finished up with my music class on Thursday with my final performance. And properly started working on Graam on Friday. I was in proper flow state on Friday night, between 8pm to 1am. I think I'll reserve that time for coding and design work everyday. And in the morning, focus on meetings, sending emails, etc. So that's all I really have to do, write emails and write code. I have 8 teachers lined up(did all that in the last week). I will have to get them to create lessons in the next few weeks and continue reaching out to more people and building out the product. I really don't have to do anything else which is great. 

<br/><br/>

Also a huge shoutout to my parents for supporting me :)

A bunch of interesting things happen this week. Apart from going to the leadership retreat, I changed the way to approach classes, differentiating myself from literally every other company doing peer to peer education stuff. I also met Jeen who gave me some really dope advice. He suggested to post about the lessons on Facebook and see what happens. I basically posted on facebook, this was my message <br/><br/>

Announcement: If you're interested in learning how to build iPhone apps, I'm hosting a 1 on 1 workshop where you learn to build an Instagram clone. Comment here or message me if you're interested. No prior coding knowledge required. Aaaaand it's free<br/><br/>

So there are four things that I wanted to focus on here, <br/> - 1 on 1 workshop <br/> - Instagram Clone <br/> - No Coding Language required <br/> - Free

<br/><br/>

My hunch is that, what attracted a lot of people was instagram clone and 1 on 1 workshop. And ofcourse, it's convenient that it's free. About 40ish people signed up. My entire week is booked. So, my goal is to teach people and create cirriculum as I teach everyone. And also recruit more teachers at the same time. I feel like recruiting teachers is going to be a little challenging, let's see what happens.

Just finished setting up most of the website. I’m still calling it Untitled because I don’t know what to call it yet. I want to choose a name that has good SEO and something for which I can get a good domain. Like Speckbit- that’s a dope name. I still have a ton of work to do, of course, right?  

<br/><br/>
My next steps are going to be getting 10 of my friends to list on the website. Once I’ve optimize their profiles, I will come up with a name and domain and start reaching out to people on craigslist. My goal is to get these 10 people in a week. i.e. by next Wednesday.
<br/><br/>
I also have to balance school stuff. I’m going to a 3 day retreat this weekend and have midterm exams all week after that. R.I.P. in pieces.
<br/><br/>
I’ spent all evening  yesterday, thinking about strategy and all day working on the website. I read and re-read all of YC’s advice. I reflected upon all the mistakes I made in my previous startup and I’ll try my best to avoid those this time around.
<br/><br/>

I also managed to find a bunch of people doing similar things as me and I was initially demotivated because they had a large number of listings and seemed to be doing pretty well. Sites like CourseHorse and lessons.com are doing pretty well. And then I remembered a talk Jony Ive gave. He said that Apple doesn’t get into a business or market without being sure that they can create a much better product. <br/><br/>

After playing around with these platforms, I realized that I would never use these platforms. lessons.com has a weird UI like thumbtack and I have to answer a million questions before finding someone good. I did like their messaging service though. But it seems like they don’t have enough experts on their platform like how airbnb has houses. Which could be a potential challenge for me. Coursehorse on the other hand is doing pretty well, but they’re more of a listing site for larger institutions. I sent them an email asking if they let individuals list classes and they responded by saying I need to at least have a website. I also read their tech crunch article where they said that they don’t let individuals list on their website. I wonder why they took that decision? <br/><br/>

So this is definitely an area that could use some serious innovations and the upside if things go accoring to plan is really good. I could be too optimistic but with a bunch of innovations on top of this project, we can create an alternative to universities and even end up changing the way people go through education. Which is super exciting.<br/><br/>

I also need to build a solid leadership team along the way, so let's see how that goes. <br/><br/>
