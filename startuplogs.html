 <div class="row">     
Just finished setting up most of the website. I’m still calling it Untitled because I don’t know what to call it yet. I want to choose a name that has good SEO and something for which I can get a good domain. Like Speckbit- that’s a dope name. I still have a ton of work to do, of course, right?  

<br/><br/>
My next steps are going to be getting 10 of my friends to list on the website. Once I’ve optimize their profiles, I will come up with a name and domain and start reaching out to people on craigslist. My goal is to get these 10 people in a week. i.e. by next Wednesday.
<br/><br/>
I also have to balance school stuff. I’m going to a 3 day retreat this weekend and have midterm exams all week after that. R.I.P. in pieces.
<br/><br/>
I’ spent all evening  yesterday, thinking about strategy and all day working on the website. I read and re-read all of YC’s advice. I reflected upon all the mistakes I made in my previous startup and I’ll try my best to avoid those this time around.
<br/><br/>

I also managed to find a bunch of people doing similar things as me and I was initially demotivated because they had a large number of listings and seemed to be doing pretty well. Sites like CourseHorse and lessons.com are doing pretty well. And then I remembered a talk Jony Ive gave. He said that Apple doesn’t get into a business or market without being sure that they can create a much better product. <br/><br/>

After playing around with these platforms, I realized that I would never use these platforms. lessons.com has a weird UI like thumbtack and I have to answer a million questions before finding someone good. I did like their messaging service though. But it seems like they don’t have enough experts on their platform like how airbnb has houses. Which could be a potential challenge for me. Coursehorse on the other hand is doing pretty well, but they’re more of a listing site for larger institutions. I sent them an email asking if they let individuals list classes and they responded by saying I need to at least have a website. I also read their tech crunch article where they said that they don’t let individuals list on their website. I wonder why they took that decision? <br/><br/>

So this is definitely an area that could use some serious innovations and the upside if things go accoring to plan is really good. I could be too optimistic but with a bunch of innovations on top of this project, we can create an alternative to universities and even end up changing the way people go through education. Which is super exciting.<br/><br/>

I also need to build a solid leadership team along the way, so let's see how that goes. <br/><br/>
