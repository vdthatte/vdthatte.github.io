                    I'm going to stop reading all the self-help, psychology crap from now on. A lot of it is starting to feel like pseudo-science. It also feels like, I'm more attracted to it because I want to get better at the playing status games between me and the people I regularly interact with. One of the things I want to do is become aware of the status games I play and stop playing them. They're incredibly distracting and take time away from the things that are more important to me in life. I also want to start learning more hard sciences, more quantum mechanics, evolutionary biology, crispr stuff, chemistry, AI & machine learning, etc. - I'd rather have my mental models defined by hard sciences than pop culture. So let's see how this goes!

                    A lot of my smart friends who are a few years older than me (late 20s) are getting into this weird limbo where they want to start taking it "easy" or "slow down" and "live their life" and "focus on family" and "focus on relationships", etc., etc., etc. - I think it's a huge fucking problem. These people are really smart. They're the top 0.1% of the world's population in terms of their capacity to make an impact in the world. And because they're so capable, I think they have a huge responsibility to work hard and contribute to progress. Most of humanity's progress truly depends on these people. If they don't do anything, nothing will happen and we'll ascend to the dark ages again. I think the reason why these people think this way is because 1. they don't realize how privileged/smart/capable they are 2. they're not aware of how much responsibility and impact they have on the world 3. they're stuck in weird status seeking games with their tiny ass, boring group of friends. Progress doesn't happen on its own, it only happens when smart people work like hell. Please get your shit together my dear friends and do something useful for humanity's sake.

                    I wonder how much crap you'll have to go through to get famous or become successful. All the people I know and look up to have gone through some insane life tragedies. Kind of reminds me of this Ribbonfarm essay - "Key to act two" where you have to go through 8 major tortures in life  to become a "key" - I don't know how true this is but it definitely seems like an interesting heuristic. The reason why I'm thinking about this is because I just finished watching a Bollywood movie, I hadn't watched a Bollywood movie for almost 2 years now. I found this clip on YouTube and thought it was hilarious and had to watch it (I may or may not have been intoxicated) - But this movie is basically about how this dude, ambitious, wants to be a rockstar, learns from his uncle or mentor that he needs to go through a heart-break in order to get inspired to write music. So he tries to fall in love and get his heart broken. I think Bollywood movies have the most cringe storylines but I have to say, I was pretty impressed by how well this movie was made. It also came out when I was in high school apparently, I had no idea. I was able to relate to the main character because that's me, except I'm obsessed with building a company - and the crap that I've had to go through in the last few years have turned me into who I am, I wouldn't trade any of those experiences, good or bad. Although, I wonder if I can speed up all the tortures so I can get to my goals quicker. hah.

                    Writing is useful. It not only helps me think better, but it's a great way to show others that I'm capable of thinking. I enjoy writing, it's a form of creation and I like to create things. I can also influence the world around me in little ways through it. But for me at least, writing feels like a daunting task. Using Substack or Medium.com or any of the existing long-form blogging tools makes me want to dedicate a lot of effort to create something. I have a lot of ideas but I don't know if they can fill up a 1000 word essay nor do I have the time to do so. I also don't think that my thoughts are short enough to be a tweet. The medium of creation does influence what we make. So I'm going to invent my own medium for my writing. All I want to do is write a paragraph dedicated to a topic. It doesn't have to be a long post, or a bite sized, attention grabbing tweet. It's a well formed thought that I want to share with the world, and nothing more. It's an experiment!
