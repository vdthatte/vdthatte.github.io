  I graduated from NYU during May 2018 with a degree in Computer Science and I'm working on my own company, Graam. <span class="greenUnderline">Graam's mission is to mobilize creators all over the world to share skills with people in their community</span>. My areas of expertise include product design, sales and outreach, marketing, branding, full stack web development, native app development, and much much more. Considering that I have to do all of these being the only person on my team. & I absolutely love it.

  I started making apps during the winter break of freshman year. I remember being glued to the screen all winter when it was snowing outside, trying to get things to work. By the end of my one month of winter break, I had a simple app. This was only the beginning, within a few months I found myself freelancing, and interning as an iOS developer. I still continue to freelance and launch my own products to this day which really helps me improve my skills as a programmer.

I'm addicted to coffee and running. When I'm not working on Graam or hanging with people, I'm usually making music.
