  I started making apps during the winter break of freshman year. I remember being glued to the screen all winter when it was snowing outside, trying to get things to work. By the end of my one month of winter break, I had a simple app. This was only the beginning, within a few months I found myself freelancing, and interning as an iOS developer. I still continue to freelance and launch my own products to this day which really helps me improve my skills as a programmer
